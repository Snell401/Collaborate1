### Random Fritata:
Feeds 4, Preparation time - 20 mins

Ingredients:
1 large head of broccoli, florets evenly chopped and stem finely chopped
1 small onion, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 tbsp butter
10 eggs
2 large handfuls of grated cheese (I use mature Cheddar or you could use crumbled feta or goat’s cheese)
Sea salt and black pepper
Optional extras:

A handful of chopped fresh basil, parsley, chives or celery leaves
Chilli flakes, to taste
2 handfuls of wild garlic, chopped (when in season)
Method:
Grab a medium-sized, deep-sided frying pan and steam the broccoli for 3 minutes in about 4 tablespoons of water, lid on, until almost tender and just turned bright green.

Drain any excess liquid (though the broccoli will probably absorb it all) and set the broccoli aside.

Pop the pan back on the heat and gently fry the red onion rings and garlic in the butter for a few minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk the eggs together in a bowl, add salt, pepper and the cheese, plus any of the herbs, chilli flakes or wild garlic, if using. Preheat the grill to high.

Add the broccoli back to the pan to coat in the garlic butter, then pour in the egg mix, stirring so that the broccoli and onions are distributed evenly. Let the bottom and sides cook and start to set over a medium heat for about 5 minutes.

Pop the frittata under the grill for a further 5 minutes until golden on top and just cooked through (give the pan a wobble to check), then slide it onto a chopping board or plate. Cool for 10 minutes and slice up into quarters.

Hey I am Eleni and I just started coding. It 's nice and frustrating at the same time.

Moreover, I love dancing, cooking animals and houseplants.


Traditional Greek bean soup  JUHUUUU
500g dry white beans (18 ounces)
3–4 carrots, finely chopped
1 large white onion, finely chopped (if you love onions, add one more!)
3 stalks of celery, finely chopped
130ml extra virgin olive oil (1/2 cup)
2 tbsps tomato paste
a pinch of paprika (hot or sweet, according to preferance)
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste (min 2 flat teaspoons each)

To prepare the fasolada (Greek bean soup), place the beans in a saucepan with plenty of cold water to cover them. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down to medium and parboil for 30-35 minutes, until slightly tender. Drain in colander and set aside.
Finely chop the onion, celery and carrots. Add 3-4 tbsps of olive oil in a deep pan, add the chopped vegetables and blend. Sauté for about 2 minutes and add the tomato paste and continue sautéing for a minute.
Add the parboiled beans in the pan and pour in enough boiling water to cover the beans and little bit more and blend lightly. Place the lid on and simmer the fasolada for about 35 minutes, until the beans are tender.
Towards the end of cooking time, pour in the remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Boil for a few more minutes, until the soup becomes thick and creamy.
Serve this traditional Greek bean soup (fasolada) while still steaming hot with a few Kalamata olives and of course some village bread. Enjoy!
