Hey I am Eleni and I just started coding. It 's nice and frustrating at the same time.

Moreover, I love dancing, cooking animals and houseplants.


Traditional Greek bean soup 

500g dry white beans (18 ounces)
3–4 carrots, finely chopped
1 large white onion, finely chopped (if you love onions, add one more!)
3 stalks of celery, finely chopped
130ml extra virgin olive oil (1/2 cup)
2 tbsps tomato paste
a pinch of paprika (hot or sweet, according to preferance)
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste (min 2 flat teaspoons each)

To prepare the fasolada (Greek bean soup), place the beans in a saucepan with plenty of cold water to cover them. Bring to the boil, turn the heat down to medium and parboil for 30-35 minutes, until slightly tender. Drain in colander and set aside.
Finely chop the onion, celery and carrots. Add 3-4 tbsps of olive oil in a deep pan, add the chopped vegetables and blend. Sauté for about 2 minutes and add the tomato paste and continue sautéing for a minute.
Add the parboiled beans in the pan and pour in enough boiling water to cover the beans and little bit more and blend lightly. Place the lid on and simmer the fasolada for about 35 minutes, until the beans are tender.
Towards the end of cooking time, pour in the remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Boil for a few more minutes, until the soup becomes thick and creamy.
Serve this traditional Greek bean soup (fasolada) while still steaming hot with a few Kalamata olives and of course some village bread. Enjoy!

Let s see if something changes
